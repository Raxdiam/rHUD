import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

When you try to run a script on a server that doesn't match the original account's credentials (or license key), 
FiveM will block execution and display this error in your server console (or client F8 console):
```
You lack the required entitlement to use rhud
```

## Causes and Solutions

1. ### Server Not Restarted  
   After purchasing or transferring the resource, your server session may still be using outdated entitlement data.
   <Callout title="Solution">
     - **Perform a full server restart:** Shut down your server completely, wait a few seconds, and start it again.  
     - **Verify the console logs:** After restarting, check the server console to confirm if the entitlement error persists.
   </Callout>

2. ### Incorrect License Key  
   The server could be using a license key that is not linked to the account that owns the resource.
   <Callout title="Solution">
     - **Confirm correct license key:** Log-in to the [Cfx.re Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/) with the **same account** that purchased (or currently holds) the resource.
     - **Create or copy the key:** copy the license key for your server, or create a new key if needed.
     - **Apply key in `server.cfg`:** Update your server's `server.cfg` file with the new license key:
       ```cfg
       sv_licenseKey "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"
       ```
     - **Restart the server**
   </Callout>

3. ### Purchased on the Wrong Account  
   If the resource was purchased on a different account and you need it on yours (or vice versa), you will need to transfer ownership.
   <Callout title="Solution">
     **Transfer Ownership:**
     1. Log-in to the [Cfx.re Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/) with the **account that purchased the resource**.
     2. Go to the **Assets** tab.
     3. Choose the resource and click **Transfer**.
     4. Enter the **recipient's Cfx.re username** when prompted and click **Transfer**.[^1]
   </Callout>

## Causes and Solutions
1. ### Missing or Corrupted Encrypted Files
   The `.fxap` file is either missing or was corrupted during file transfer. Some file transfer methods or certain FTP client (such as FileZilla) are known to skip or corrupt encrypted files.
   <Callout title="Solution">
     - **Include the `.fxap` file:** Make sure the `.fxap` file is present in the resource folder.
     - **Use an alternative FTP client:** Switch to a more reliable FTP client such as WinSCP to ensure the `.fxap` file is properly uploaded.
     - **Re-download:** If the error persists, download the resource from the [Cfx.re Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/) again in case it was corrupted during download the last time.
   </Callout>
2. ### Outdated Server Version
   If your server is below a certain version (commonly 5181+), the resource may fail verification.
   <Callout title="Solution">
     - **Check your current artifacts version:** Update your server artifacts to version 5181 or higher (or the latest available version).[^1]
     - **Restart your server:** After updating, perform a full server restart to apply the changes.
   </Callout>
3. ### Improper Installation Method
   Transferring the resource folder file by file instead of uploading the entire `.zip` can lead to missing or corrupted files.
   <Callout title="Solution">
     - **Upload the `.zip` directly:** Transfer the ZIP file in its entirety to your VPS and extract it there.
     - **Avoid partial uploads:** Ensure the entire directory (including hidden files) is intact after extraction.
   </Callout>
4. ### Restart Requirements
   If you have just uploaded or updated the resource without restarting the server, verification may fail.
    <Callout title="Solution">
      Restart the server after uploading or updating the resource.
    </Callout>

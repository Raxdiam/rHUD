Postal codes are supported and displayed, but rHUD does not come with its own postal map.\
To use your own postal codes, replace the default `rhud/data/postals.json`[^1] with your own.

## Postal Codes File
The postal codes file is a JSON array of objects, where each object contains the following properties:
| Property | Type   | Description                         |
|----------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| `code`   | string | The postal code                     |
| `x`      | number | The X-coordinate of the postal code |
| `y`      | number | The Y-coordinate of the postal code |

```json title="Example"
[
  { "code": "001", "x": 57.89, "y": 7211.67 },
  { "code": "002", "x": 172.54, "y": 7081.23 },
  { "code": "003", "x": 76.15, "y": 7029.15 },
]
```

### If your postal codes file isn't working
1. Make sure the file name is `postals.json` and is located in the `rhud/data` folder.
2. Check the contents of your postal codes file. Make sure the format is consistent with the example in the above [Postal Codes File](#postal-codes-file) section.

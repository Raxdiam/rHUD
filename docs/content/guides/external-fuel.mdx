title: External Fuel Script
---

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

If the built-in fuel script isn't sufficient for your needs, an external fuel script can be used.

## Edit `GetFuelLevel`
To make use of an the external fuel script of your choice, you will need to edit the `GetFuelLevel` function in `functions.lua`.\
We will use [BigDaddy-Fuel](https://wiki.bigdaddyscripts.com/documentation/fuel) as an example external fuel script.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open `functions.lua` in the `rhud` resource folder in the text editor of your choice.[^1]
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to your external fuel script's documentation (if it has one) and find the export that retrieves the fuel level.\
    For `BigDaddy-Fuel`, this export is `exports['BigDaddy-Fuel']:GetFuel(vehicle)`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Replace the contents of the `GetFuelLevel` function to return the fuel level using the external fuel script's export.

    ```lua title="functions.lua"
    --- Gets the fuel level of a vehicle. Used by all vehicle modules.
    --- @param veh integer The vehicle handle.
    --- @return number fuel The fuel level of the vehicle as a percentage.
    function GetFuelLevel(veh)
      local max = GetVehicleHandlingFloat(veh, 'CHandlingData', 'fPetrolTankVolume') -- [!code --]
      local fuel = GetVehicleFuelLevel(veh) -- [!code --]
      return (fuel / max) * 100 -- [!code --]
      return exports['BigDaddy-Fuel']:GetFuel(veh) -- [!code ++]
    end
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Save `functions.lua` and restart rHUD or your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add Dependency (Optional)
To ensure that rHUD starts **after** the external fuel script, you can add the external fuel script as a dependency of rHUD in its `fxmanifest.lua`.

```lua title="fxmanifest.lua"
-- above contents of fxmanifest.lua ...

dependency '/assetpacks' -- [!code --]
dependencies { -- [!code ++]
  '/assetpacks', -- [!code ++]
  'BigDaddy-Fuel', -- [!code ++]
} -- [!code ++]
```
